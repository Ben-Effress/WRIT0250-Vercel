# WRIT0250-Vercel
This is a deployed rendering of my final draft of my op-ed for WRIT 0250 - Writing Seminar in CIMS: Star Wars Music.
In this op-ed, I write about the importance of keeping indie movie theaters alive because they preserve the
magic of movie theaters while also showing lesser-known independent films that cannot be seen in big theaters.

This project is modeled as though it were an article on Indiewire.com, a publication that often posts opinion
articles about movie-related topics.

This project is deployed using Vercel and can be accessed here: writ-0250-op-ed.vercel.app.
